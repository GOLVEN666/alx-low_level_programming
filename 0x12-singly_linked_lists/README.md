This project was completed as part of my Full Stack Software Engineering studies at ALX AFRICA SE. Its purpose is to learn about linked lists in the C language.

Technologies
C files are compiled using gcc.
Tested on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS.
Files
The following files are written in C:

Filename	Description
0-print_list.c	Prints all the elements of a list_t list.
1-list_len.c	Returns the number of elements in a linked list_t list.
2-add_node.c	Adds a new node at the beginning of a list_t list.
3-add_node_end.c	Adds a new node at the end of a list_t list.
4-free_list.c	Frees a list_t list.
100-first.c	Prints a message before the main function is executed.
101-hello_holberton.asm	Assembly code that prints Hello, Holberton using only the printf function.
Description
The project provides an understanding of linked lists and how to manipulate them in the C programming language. The code is written to accomplish various tasks such as printing all elements of a linked list, adding and removing nodes, and counting the number of nodes in a list.

Style
The README.md file is written in a clear and concise style. The file contains a brief description of the project, the technologies used, and a table that provides details about each file. The headings and subheadings are appropriately used, and the file is formatted using markdown syntax.

Nested loops are like the bread and butter of looping statements - they're all about loops inside loops! That's why they're also referred to as "loop inside loop." And, hold onto your hats folks, because these bad boys can really spice up your programming game!

But, as with any good code, you've got to start with the basics. That's why we've created a main.h file - a header file that contains all of the function prototypes used in this project. This is where you set the stage for your program to really shine!

Now, let's talk about the actual functions. In file 0-isupper.c, you'll find a function that checks for uppercase characters. In file 1-isdigit.c, you'll find a function that checks for digits between 0 and 9.

But wait, there's more! File 2-mul.c contains a function that multiplies two integers together. File 3-print_numbers.c prints out the numbers 0 through 9, followed by a brand-spanking-new line. And in file 4-print_most_numbers.c, you'll find a function that prints out the numbers 0 through 9, except for the digits 2 and 4, followed by a shiny new line.

Now, let's get wild! File 5-more_numbers.c has a function that prints out the numbers 0 through 14, ten times over, followed by a new line. And in file 6-print_line.c, you'll find a function that draws a straight line in your terminal.

But wait, there's more! File 7-print_diagonal.c contains a function that draws a diagonal line in your terminal, while file 8-print_square.c prints out a square, followed by a new line. And in file 9-fizz_buzz.c, you'll find a program that prints out the numbers from 1 to 100, except for the multiples of 3 (which get replaced by the word "Fizz") and multiples of 5 (which get replaced by the word "Buzz").

Last but not least, file 10-print_triangle.c contains a function that prints out a triangle, followed by a new line. And in file 100-prime_factor.c, you'll find a program that finds and prints out the largest prime factor of the number 612852475143, followed by a new line.

Finally, to top it all off, file 101-print_number.c has a function that prints out an integer using only the _putchar() function. And, let's not forget about file _putchar.c, which contains the _putchar() function definition.

So, get ready to strap on your programming helmets and dive headfirst into these functions, because with nested loops and these functions, the sky's the limit!
